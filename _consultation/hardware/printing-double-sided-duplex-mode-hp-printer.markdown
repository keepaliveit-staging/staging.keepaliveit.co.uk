You may be wondering how to utilise your printer to print on both sides of a single piece of paper.
In computing terms, this process is known as duplex printing. Unfortunately, not all printers support a duplex printing mode.
Within your computers operating system, you may have a greyed out box for printing on both sides of a page. Many people believe that if their printer doesn't support printing double sided if the double sided printing option is greyed out. 
However, there is a simple workaround to this problem but it involves having to manually add and remove pages from your printer.


One of the biggest problems of printing two single pages on one single piece of paper for printers that do not support duplex printing is that you will have to manually setup the printer to be able to print odd and even pages each time.

For simple prints, this isn't really an issue. For prints that are hundreds of pages long there is a possibility that the print you are making is going to be printied in reverse order, or pages will become jammed in the printer tray.
