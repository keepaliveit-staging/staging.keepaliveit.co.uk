## Managed Wifi Access Points

<!--
<div>
    Fully managed WiFi, setup securely, and fully managed by experts with no monthly fees! &nbsp;<br><br>Make sure your
    WiFi is setup correctly, with full coverage across buildings, with one WiFi name so you can roam seamlessly without
    any interruption to your connection, and the right security setup from the start. &nbsp;<br><br>Want to make sure
    guest access for visitors to your home or office is secure and doesn't put your own network at risk? &nbsp;Need
    public WiFi for your offices, for your cafe, pub, club or visitors area but not sure how to make it fully secure and
    keep your own networks safe, whilst using the same internet connection?<br><br>Our fully managed WiFi access points
    and systems allow you to do all this, and the best thing is, you don't have to worry about setting it up, managing
    it, or keeping all the devices up to date and secure, we'll do it all for you, included in the price, so no extra
    monthly fees! &nbsp; &nbsp;If you need to change the security, passwords, network names etc, then we do it for you
    and in minutes all your access points will be updated, quite literally, wherever they are in the world.<br><br>All
    units are kept up to date for security, so you don't need to worry about complication firmware updates, which most
    people never do to their routers and access points, putting your networks at risk.<br><br>Take the worry out of
    managing WiFi access properly, anywhere in the world, without hefty management fees, and never having to get
    technical again!<br><br>
