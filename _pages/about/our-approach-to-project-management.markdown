<h2>The Keep-Alive I.T approach to project management</h2>

We're focused on getting things right from the beginning of a project, all the way to it's closure

Identification
The first step involved with managing a project is identifying the project's requirements.

Understanding project requirements when working with I.T projects often means doing teardowns of current processes or practises and understanding the dataflow throughout this process.



Delegation
Once it is made clear 

Satisfaction
This part of managing a project often comes in feedback loops.

With feedback comes metrics. With metrics comes targets.



<p>We understand not everyone is a 'tech wizzard' when it comes to dealing with I.T, so this is why we've written guides on how to perform common computing tasks. We hope our guides are a valuable learning resource and can help you take the 'DIY approach' to maintaining your I.T.</p>
