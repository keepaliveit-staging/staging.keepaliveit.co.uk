## The process of working with us

If you've never worked with an I.T consultancy company before, we want to make it easier for you to understand the process involved with working with us.
We understand it may seem 

We'll ask for your contact details

### What does the process of working with Keep Alive I.T involve?
This depends on the type of work you need completed. As a general rule, there are 7 steps involved in working with us:

1. You contact us and supply us with a description of the work that you need completed. This can be a one page document explaining what our deliverables should be from your project, or if you want us to work on a relatively new project, you should supply us with a detailed Brief or Design Document for your new idea.

2. We do some research and a brief technical review of the work you’ve supplied us with and let you know within a few days if it’s feasible and a piece of work we’re capable of taking on. At this stage, we’ll schedule a meeting with you to get to know your needs and requirements.

3. Once we’ve had a meeting with you, we’ll produce a contract for your work. This contract will contain a list of deliverables by us, as well as some legal terms that you’ll need to agree to and generally keeps both parties happy throughout the duration of the project.

4. We’ll send you the contract that’s been produced and once you’ve read through it, you’ll need to sign it electronically so work can begin. You’ll also need to send us any resources which can help us complete your work before any work can begin on your project (for example, if we’re making you a website you’ll need to send us appropriate branding materials).

5. This is where you can relax and our hard work begins. We’ll plan, design, develop, and test your work and contact you if we need any additional information or resources from you. Depending on the duration of the project, you might need to play the waiting game for some time. We’ll let you know how we’re getting on with the work at different stages of the project by SMS, email, or phone.

6. We’ll send you samples of the work we have produced so you can test it and give us feedback on the work. We’re able to make minor changes during this stage if there’s anything you’re not completely happy with.

7. This marks the end of our time working together. We’ll send you over the finished works, and hopefully we can work together at some point in the future.

You can find more specific details of how the flow works for each service we offer in the Client Forms section of the Keep Alive I.T website.
