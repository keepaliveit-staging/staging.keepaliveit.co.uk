<h2>The Keep-Alive I.T approach to I.T consultancy</h2>

Weâ€™re pretty good at all of these things and can apply our I.T knowledge to your requirements, or do things how we think they should be done, as experts in the I.T field who work with technology every single day and is familiar with I.T best practises.

<p>We understand not everyone is a 'tech wizzard' when it comes to dealing with I.T, so this is why we've written guides on how to perform common computing tasks. We hope our guides are a valuable learning resource and can help you take the 'DIY approach' to maintaining your I.T.</p>
<p>If you have a request for a tech tip article, please get in touch and we will see what we can do for you.</p>

1. Not everyone is an expert

2. We'll show you what options are available

3. We'll send you a quote for the work

Our contract of working together will outline the process of what to do if you require support we've built for you.
