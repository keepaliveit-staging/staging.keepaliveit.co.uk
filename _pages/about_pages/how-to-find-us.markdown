## How to find us

### Where is Keep-Alive I.T based?

Cardiff has excellent transport links to major Road and Rail services, and also 2 local airports - allowing us to easily reach England, Ireland, Scotland, or other parts of Europe, and the rest of the World, if required. We are able to travel to our clients, or work remotely - depending on the nature of the work that needs completing.
