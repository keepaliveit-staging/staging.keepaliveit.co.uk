### The primary objective of our Business
Here at Keep-Alive I.T, the primary objective of our business is to develop and maintain I.T systems. Our business keeps its doors open by working with clients on their I.T Hardware & Software requirements. The objective of our business is to analyse, develop, and maintain robust I.T solutions. Our entire revenue stream is performance based and <strong>our client base spans different sectors, different team sizes, and involves local, national, and international reach</strong>.

Our business focuses on four core skill areas to achieve its objective. These four skill areas comprise of:
- Business Requirements Analysis Skills.
- I.T Consultancy & Software Development Skills.
- Project Management Skills.
- Customer Service / I.T Support Skills.

Our workforce is divided into consultancy, customer service, and technical roles. No day working at Keep-Alive I.T is ever the same, meaning less monotony than your usual desk job. There's also plenty of work to do as long as the World is using I.T (which in theory, its usage won't be decreasing anytime soon!), and we're continuously seeking work from clients.

#### Base requirements of working for us

#### You must like a challenge
Working for Keep-Alive I.T certainly isn't easy and is only for those who have a passion for what they do. After an initial staff onboarding period, you will be expected to work alone and regularly identify & discuss the impact of how the work you're doing is contributing towards Keep-Alive I.T's wider company goals. This brings many challenges to your work, but also gives you a level of personal satisfaction in the long run by knowing that the work you're doing is having a positive impact on the wider company. 
 
We're very greatful of the staff who work for us and believe positive outcomes should put you in situation where you can get potential pay rises. We encourage all staff to live their working day as if they're close to getting a pay rise and we regularly monitor staff performance to determine if a salary raise, or bonus should be given.
 
#### We prefer breadth of knowledge, rather than depth of knowledge.
We believe our team must be equipped with the right skills to get the job done. It’s okay for a team member to be an expert at a particular task, but we try to get our entire team equipped with the core skills needed to thrive in their job, rather than having a working role as if they're a contractor. This opens doors to continuously learning new skills and builds a happier workforce overall.
