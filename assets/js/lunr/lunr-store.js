Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a substantial amount of Cloud services that can be used to perform simple computation operations for hobbyist software developers, or running highly complex application workloads with an enterprise grade Service Level Agreement (SLA). The flexibility of using Amazon Web Services with projects has deemed it a good choice of Cloud provider due to its Capital Expenditure (CapEx) pricing model. Taking the plunge to migrate application workloads to AWS is a decision that must be made with much thought but the exact answer for that decision depends on your current I.T setup and requirements.   How much does AWS cost?  There is no definitive answer to what is the cost of AWS services as the needs and requirements of every enterprise of startup company will be different. Part of our consultancy service is giving an estimated cost as to how much it will cost to operate your application workload(s) on AWS. Some AWS services are free but some are charged at a rate defined by AWS.

What exactly is a Service Level Agreement (SLA)? A service level agreement metric is the uptime guarantee of a service and is a term most commonly used in I.T Service Management (ITSM) professions.   Shouldn’t I always choose a Service Level Agreement that’s 100%? Not necessarily. An uptime of 100% is extremely rare to come by. Even the shortest of application changes can occur some downtime for your users.   Why use Amazon Web Services?     More cost effective than hosting &amp; maintaining application workloads using on-premise hardware.   Promotes Machine Learning, Compute, Storage, and Analytics.   We can migrate data on a large scale using high performance devices with capacities of up to 5TB.   A new way of working   Say goodbye to slow boot times     Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs):                Do you do AWS migrations from other Cloud provider(s)?                      Yes. Please see our Cloud Services page for a full list of Cloud providers that we support.                            I'm worried about storing my data in a different location. Is this safe?                      Yes. All data hosted on AWS is encrypted at an enterprise standard and the keys of the encryption algorithm can be stored away from AWS servers.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a substantial amount of Cloud services that can be used to perform simple computation operations for hobbyist software developers, or running highly complex application workloads with an enterprise grade Service Level Agreement (SLA). The flexibility of using Amazon Web Services with projects has deemed it a good choice of Cloud provider due to its Capital Expenditure (CapEx) pricing model. Taking the plunge to migrate application workloads to AWS is a decision that must be made with much thought but the exact answer for that decision depends on your current I.T setup and requirements.   How much does AWS cost?  There is no definitive answer to what is the cost of AWS services as the needs and requirements of every enterprise of startup company will be different. Part of our consultancy service is giving an estimated cost as to how much it will cost to operate your application workload(s) on AWS. Some AWS services are free but some are charged at a rate defined by AWS.

If your Public Sector Organisation is thinking of utilising AWS's Cloud Services, or is already using AWS and needs some Cloud advice - we're here to consult your organisation on Cloud topics. We can give advice for existing Cloud setups, or guide your organisation to migrate its entire I.T workload to the Cloud for maximum cost savings &amp; operational benefits.                                           Discover AWS Cloud Services                                                                                                                The journey of migrating Public Sector I.T workloads to AWS Cloud technologies:               On-boarding Public Sector Organisations with Cloud technology is never an easy task and is a movement which requires a deep amount of technical knowledge to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible. The process of migrating traditional I.T infrastructure to Cloud is usually a gradual movement which can take many months, or even years to implement. Cloud migrations usually cost upwards of a few Million pounds to implement, dependant on the scale of the I.T workload being migrated. However, the cost and elasticity benefits that are introduced as a result of a cloud migration being completed are often significant enough to be considered as a solid I.T investment for Public Sector Organisations. This benefit alone often entices the movement of gradually shifting I.T workloads to be Cloud powered. Another game changing benefit of introducing Cloud movements to Public Sector Organisations, comes thanks to its elasticity characteristics. Elasticity encourages organisations to be more agile and promotes future projects to be shipped to the public up-to 1000x faster than using traditional I.T hosting environments. Once an organisation hits this point of their Cloud related journey, they will start to adapt a DevOps culture and embrace a new way of working.              The UK Government has published guidance on Public Cloud Technology on it's website. This document is suited for technical leads of Public Sector Organisations and aims to give an overview of the process of migrating I.T workloads to the Cloud. Key objectives of the document are:                               to help technical leads decide on, and implement cloud strategies.                 to help technical teams with implementing migrations to cloud services.                 to help technical teams with managing cloud resources and Cloud spending budgets.                                       As good of a resource that this is, there is much more groundwork than highlighted in this document to get I.T workloads migrated onto Cloud technologies. One of the biggest setbacks for Public Sector Organisations is that they must hire additional staff resources to even begin migrating I.T workloads. Hiring project managers, cloud experts, database experts, application developers, solutions architects, and testers certainly doesn't come cheap, and training staff to be equipped with the required skills is often he biggest hurdle to overcome.               This is where we, Keep-Alive I.T come into the equation and are able to step in and help Public Sector Organisations to make better decisions with their Cloud related work items. Operating Clouds at high scale, and maintaining Clouds for Our goal here at Keep-Alive I.T is to consult you of the steps involved with embracing Cloud technologies              If your Public Sector Organisation already has an AWS Setup that needs managing, you can jump straight to our services overview to see if hiring us to manage your Cloud infrastructure and associated applications is the right fit for your Organisation.

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of I.T resources via the internet, with a pay-as-you-go pricing model.                           Organisations of every type, size and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases. Including (but not limited to); data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and customer facing web applications. Public Sector Organisations could be utilising the benefits of an AWS Cloud to give a better experience to the public, whilst saving thousands of pounds on I.T operation costs.                                                            Amazon Web Services works like this; Instead of buying, owning and maintaining physical data centers and server on-site, you can access a gigantic pool of technology resources, such as computing power, storage and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS focuses on the setup of complex infrastructure sites across the globe and physical security of Data Centres. This means that a Public Sector Organisation has to do to reap the benefits of aPublic Cloud provider is hire a specialised team of I.T professionals to Architect, Operate, and Maintain Cloud based I.T workloads. It can often be tricky to find AWS Cloud Consultants due to the amount of technical expertise required. However, that shouldn't put Public Sector Organisations off using Cloud technologies as there are companies like Keep-Alive I.T around to help with this.                                Whether this is the first time you've come across Amazon Web Services, or you've been using Amazon Web Services for months/years, this page will include some free information on AWS topics.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a substantial amount of Cloud services that can be used to perform simple computation operations for hobbyist software developers, or running highly complex application workloads with an enterprise grade Service Level Agreement (SLA). The flexibility of using Amazon Web Services (AWS) with projects has deemed it a good choice of Cloud provider due to its Capital Expenditure (CapEx) pricing model. Taking the plunge to migrate application workloads to AWS is a decision that must be made with much thought but the exact answer for that decision depends on your current I.T setup and requirements.   How much does AWS cost?  There is no definitive answer to what is the cost of AWS services as the needs and requirements of every enterprise of startup company will be different. Part of our consultancy service is giving an estimated cost as to how much it will cost to operate your application workload(s) on AWS. Some AWS services are free but some are charged at a rate defined by AWS.

What exactly is a Service Level Agreement (SLA)? A service level agreement metric is the uptime guarantee of a service and is a term most commonly used in I.T Service Management (ITSM) professions.   Shouldn’t I always choose a Service Level Agreement that’s 100%? Not necessarily. An uptime of 100% is extremely rare to come by. Even the shortest of application changes can occur some downtime for your users.   Why use Amazon Web Services?     More cost effective than hosting &amp; maintaining application workloads using on-premise hardware.   Promotes Machine Learning, Compute, Storage, and Analytics.   We can migrate data on a large scale using high performance devices with capacities of up to 5TB.

Please see our Cloud Services page for a full list of Cloud providers that we support.                            I'm worried about storing my data in a different location. Is this safe?                      Yes. All data hosted on AWS is encrypted at an enterprise standard and the keys of the encryption algorithm can be stored away from AWS servers.

We are continuously innovating the design and systems of our data centers to protect them from man-made and natural risks. Then we implement controls, build automated systems, and undergo third-party audits to confirm security and compliance. As a result, the most highly-regulated organizations in the world trust AWS every day.    Amazon’s global infrastructure setup makes AWS the go-to Cloud platform for many Enterprises.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a substantial amount of Cloud services that can be used to perform simple computation operations for hobbyist software developers, or running highly complex application workloads with an enterprise grade Service Level Agreement (SLA). The flexibility of using Amazon Web Services with projects has deemed it a good choice of Cloud provider due to its Capital Expenditure (CapEx) pricing model. Taking the plunge to migrate application workloads to AWS is a decision that must be made with much thought but the exact answer for that decision depends on your current I.T setup and requirements.   How much does AWS cost?  There is no definitive answer to what is the cost of AWS services as the needs and requirements of every enterprise of startup company will be different. Part of our consultancy service is giving an estimated cost as to how much it will cost to operate your application workload(s) on AWS. Some AWS services are free but some are charged at a rate defined by AWS.

What exactly is a Service Level Agreement (SLA)? A service level agreement metric is the uptime guarantee of a service and is a term most commonly used in I.T Service Management (ITSM) professions.   Shouldn’t I always choose a Service Level Agreement that’s 100%? Not necessarily. An uptime of 100% is extremely rare to come by. Even the shortest of application changes can occur some downtime for your users.   Why use Amazon Web Services?     More cost effective than hosting &amp; maintaining application workloads using on-premise hardware.   Promotes Machine Learning, Compute, Storage, and Analytics.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a substantial amount of Cloud services that can be used to perform simple computation operations for hobbyist software developers, or running highly complex application workloads with an enterprise grade Service Level Agreement (SLA). The flexibility of using Amazon Web Services with projects has deemed it a good choice of Cloud provider due to its Capital Expenditure (CapEx) pricing model. Taking the plunge to migrate application workloads to AWS is a decision that must be made with much thought but the exact answer for that decision depends on your current I.T setup and requirements.   How much does AWS cost?  There is no definitive answer to what is the cost of AWS services as the needs and requirements of every enterprise of startup company will be different. Part of our consultancy service is giving an estimated cost as to how much it will cost to operate your application workload(s) on AWS. Some AWS services are free but some are charged at a rate defined by AWS.

What exactly is a Service Level Agreement (SLA)? A service level agreement metric is the uptime guarantee of a service and is a term most commonly used in I.T Service Management (ITSM) professions.   Shouldn’t I always choose a Service Level Agreement that’s 100%? Not necessarily. An uptime of 100% is extremely rare to come by. Even the shortest of application changes can occur some downtime for your users.   Why use Amazon Web Services?     More cost effective than hosting &amp; maintaining application workloads using on-premise hardware.   Promotes Machine Learning, Compute, Storage, and Analytics.   We can migrate data on a large scale using high performance devices with capacities of up to 5TB.   A new way of working   Say goodbye to slow boot times     Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs):                Do you do AWS migrations from other Cloud provider(s)?                      Yes. Please see our Cloud Services page for a full list of Cloud providers that we support.                            I'm worried about storing my data in a different location. Is this safe?                      Yes. All data hosted on AWS is encrypted at an enterprise standard and the keys of the encryption algorithm can be stored away from AWS servers.                            How much time do your  I.T Operations Consultancy Services take to implement or perform?

Unfortunately, not all printers support a duplex printing mode. Within your computers operating system, you may have a greyed out box for printing on both sides of a page. Many people believe that if their printer doesn’t support printing double sided if the double sided printing option is greyed out.  However, there is a simple workaround to this problem but it involves having to manually add and remove pages from your printer.   One of the biggest problems of printing two single pages on one single piece of paper for printers that do not support duplex printing is that you will have to manually setup the printer to be able to print odd and even pages each time.   For simple prints, this isn’t really an issue. For prints that are hundreds of pages long there is a possibility that the print you are making is going to be printied in reverse order, or pages will become jammed in the printer tray.   youtube.com/watch?v=gMa39SbYdiM  ","categories": ["Hardware"],

It’s a great honour for me to be able to write the very first blog post for the Keep-Alive I.T website.

I’d like to take the time to write a brief introduction to Keep-Alive I.T explaining this new venture, our mission statement, and what the company hopes to bring myself and future clients in the medium-to-long term.   Who is ‘me’? Good question. My name is Joel Murphy and I am the founder of Keep-Alive I.T Services.

In addition to taking on this role, I will also be working towards leading the company in a positive direction for the future.

Reasons for founding Keep-Alive I.T  I founded Keep-Alive I.T because I’ve worked in a range of different office environments in the Public and Private sector and seen some of the good and bad sides to different technology implementations at different organisations in both, Windows and Linux Operating System environments. Sure, not everyone gets things right first time but when you’re constantly seeing newbies (or people who think they’re experienced with something - when in reality they have absolutely no clue about) implementing old, dying technologies at a company just because they have a senior status without any redundancy or intention of scale, it makes you wonder if there’s any hope at all for running reliable systems in production. When you’re an employee at an organisation, you sort of learn to shut your mouth and go with whatever solution you’re told to work towards. Consulting on the other hand is a great opportunity to make use of the expert skills you’ve acquired after so many years working with different technologies and seeing them grow over time. With this in mind, it has motivated me to start a company consulting clients on Development and operations  As someone who keeps up to date with the latest and greatest technolgies, focuses on best practises, and practises development and operational I.T procedures; I see myself as a strong candidate for ‘bridging the gap’ between business and I.T workers and help break down complex technical problems into a language that others can easily understand.

Continual training enc      Morale – Staff satisfaction is very important within a company. If individuals are satisfied with their role, then morale is increased, which in turn, increases work output. Training helps to make people more confident in their role, which directly improves morale. It is important in maintaining morale that staff are trained equally.       Productivity – Better training means better processes. Tasks can be performed far quicker if employees know what they’re doing, and quality of work will also improve. Mistakes that could slow systems down are also far less likely to occur if individuals have the best training for the job that they do. There is also the chance that particularly well trained staff will be able to see where improvements could be made.       Safety – For many businesses, staff safety is the number one priority. Employees lacking in knowledge and skill are more likely to have an accident in the workplace. Training helps to eliminate this as a cause. Many accidents happen because staff do not know how to properly use or store a piece of equipment, so it’s essential they do.       Value – Well trained employees become assets for a business. They add value to the company as a whole, and make internal promotion easier. Promotion from within is of obvious benefit to a company – staff already have a good knowledge of the business and relationships with other members of the workforce.       Independence – Fewer supervisors are needed when staff know exactly what they need to be doing, and how they need to do it. A fully trained workforce can be trusted to operate independently without making mistakes or slowing processes.         What software exists for performing task X?     Is software X better than software Y? If so, why?     How much will it cost to operate software X for a short term project?     Does software X seem appropriate for our business needs?

Source: https://bdaily.co.uk/articles/2012/09/09/5-benefits-of-a-well-trained-workforce   Software Training Solutions  Having well trained employees makes the workplace a far better place to work overall.   According to Bdaily, there are 5 principles which make a difference for business performance.   Continual training enc      Morale – Staff satisfaction is very important within a company. If individuals are satisfied with their role, then morale is increased, which in turn, increases work output. Training helps to make people more confident in their role, which directly improves morale. It is important in maintaining morale that staff are trained equally.       Productivity – Better training means better processes. Tasks can be performed far quicker if employees know what they’re doing, and quality of work will also improve. Mistakes that could slow systems down are also far less likely to occur if individuals have the best training for the job that they do. There is also the chance that particularly well trained staff will be able to see where improvements could be made.       Safety – For many businesses, staff safety is the number one priority. Employees lacking in knowledge and skill are more likely to have an accident in the workplace. Training helps to eliminate this as a cause. Many accidents happen because staff do not know how to properly use or store a piece of equipment, so it’s essential they do.       Value – Well trained employees become assets for a business. They add value to the company as a whole, and make internal promotion easier. Promotion from within is of obvious benefit to a company – staff already have a good knowledge of the business and relationships with other members of the workforce.       Independence – Fewer supervisors are needed when staff know exactly what they need to be doing, and how they need to do it. A fully trained workforce can be trusted to operate independently without making mistakes or slowing processes.         What software exists for performing task X?     Is software X better than software Y? If so, why?     How much will it cost to operate software X for a short term project?     Does software X seem appropriate for our business needs?     Should I consider a commercial or open source implementation?   Cost of our Software Training services  Prices start at £1000 per day. Please enquire for more information.

Sometimes it is still a remote team with more specific knowledge then the Support Desk (1st line). This as I say is the first set of onsite personnel (normally), usually dealing with (not always) minor issues such as workstation problems, printer, scanner and peripheral issues that were not able to be resolved by the 1st Line Support.   3rd Line Support – Most of the time a more specialised individual or team for onsite contact – Job titles such as Network Specialist, Server Specialist/Engineer and many more specialised job roles.

Continual training enc      Morale – Staff satisfaction is very important within a company. If individuals are satisfied with their role, then morale is increased, which in turn, increases work output. Training helps to make people more confident in their role, which directly improves morale. It is important in maintaining morale that staff are trained equally.       Productivity – Better training means better processes. Tasks can be performed far quicker if employees know what they’re doing, and quality of work will also improve. Mistakes that could slow systems down are also far less likely to occur if individuals have the best training for the job that they do. There is also the chance that particularly well trained staff will be able to see where improvements could be made.       Safety – For many businesses, staff safety is the number one priority. Employees lacking in knowledge and skill are more likely to have an accident in the workplace. Training helps to eliminate this as a cause. Many accidents happen because staff do not know how to properly use or store a piece of equipment, so it’s essential they do.       Value – Well trained employees become assets for a business. They add value to the company as a whole, and make internal promotion easier. Promotion from within is of obvious benefit to a company – staff already have a good knowledge of the business and relationships with other members of the workforce.       Independence – Fewer supervisors are needed when staff know exactly what they need to be doing, and how they need to do it. A fully trained workforce can be trusted to operate independently without making mistakes or slowing processes.         What software exists for performing task X?     Is software X better than software Y? If so, why?     How much will it cost to operate software X for a short term project?     Does software X seem appropriate for our business needs?

Sometimes it is still a remote team with more specific knowledge then the Support Desk (1st line). This as I say is the first set of onsite personnel (normally), usually dealing with (not always) minor issues such as workstation problems, printer, scanner and peripheral issues that were not able to be resolved by the 1st Line Support.   3rd Line Support – Most of the time a more specialised individual or team for onsite contact – Job titles such as Network Specialist, Server Specialist/Engineer and many more specialised job roles.   When these personnel appear you know you’ve got a problem These are usually more qualified individuals, such as Microsoft Certified in the case of MS Windows Server issues.

Continual training enc      Morale – Staff satisfaction is very important within a company. If individuals are satisfied with their role, then morale is increased, which in turn, increases work output. Training helps to make people more confident in their role, which directly improves morale. It is important in maintaining morale that staff are trained equally.       Productivity – Better training means better processes. Tasks can be performed far quicker if employees know what they’re doing, and quality of work will also improve. Mistakes that could slow systems down are also far less likely to occur if individuals have the best training for the job that they do. There is also the chance that particularly well trained staff will be able to see where improvements could be made.       Safety – For many businesses, staff safety is the number one priority. Employees lacking in knowledge and skill are more likely to have an accident in the workplace. Training helps to eliminate this as a cause. Many accidents happen because staff do not know how to properly use or store a piece of equipment, so it’s essential they do.       Value – Well trained employees become assets for a business. They add value to the company as a whole, and make internal promotion easier. Promotion from within is of obvious benefit to a company – staff already have a good knowledge of the business and relationships with other members of the workforce.       Independence – Fewer supervisors are needed when staff know exactly what they need to be doing, and how they need to do it. A fully trained workforce can be trusted to operate independently without making mistakes or slowing processes.         What software exists for performing task X?     Is software X better than software Y? If so, why?     How much will it cost to operate software X for a short term project?     Does software X seem appropriate for our business needs?     Should I consider a commercial or open source implementation?     Why choose Keep-Alive I.T?

Sometimes it is still a remote team with more specific knowledge then the Support Desk (1st line).

Continual training enc      Morale – Staff satisfaction is very important within a company. If individuals are satisfied with their role, then morale is increased, which in turn, increases work output. Training helps to make people more confident in their role, which directly improves morale. It is important in maintaining morale that staff are trained equally.       Productivity – Better training means better processes. Tasks can be performed far quicker if employees know what they’re doing, and quality of work will also improve. Mistakes that could slow systems down are also far less likely to occur if individuals have the best training for the job that they do. There is also the chance that particularly well trained staff will be able to see where improvements could be made.       Safety – For many businesses, staff safety is the number one priority. Employees lacking in knowledge and skill are more likely to have an accident in the workplace. Training helps to eliminate this as a cause. Many accidents happen because staff do not know how to properly use or store a piece of equipment, so it’s essential they do.       Value – Well trained employees become assets for a business. They add value to the company as a whole, and make internal promotion easier. Promotion from within is of obvious benefit to a company – staff already have a good knowledge of the business and relationships with other members of the workforce.       Independence – Fewer supervisors are needed when staff know exactly what they need to be doing, and how they need to do it. A fully trained workforce can be trusted to operate independently without making mistakes or slowing processes.         What software exists for performing task X?

Tech is expanding 2.6x times faster than the rest of the UK economy. The digital tech sector is worth nearly £184 billion to UK economy, up from £170 billion in 2016. (Source: Tech Nation’s 2018 report)    In the modern technology focused era that we live in, I.T has become the backbone of nearly every business, regardless of its industry type, size, or sector. In the past decade, manual paper processes have become electronic and an increased amount of Software Applications, Servers, and Networks has resulted in businesses relying on I.T operations for data handling purposes more than ever before. However, I.T isn’t always reliable as it should be and is subject to failure at any time of the day or night, causing potential issues for business productivity.   Low Availability prompts inconvenience. I.T Threats prompt Legalities. Don’t let either of these risks affect your business.  Depending on the severity of an I.T issue, the outcome of an I.T failure can be catastrophic to the reputation of a business. Companies try to overcome such risks by quickly designing &amp; executing reactive recovery strategies, but often it is too late to take action as customers go elsewhere to spend their money if the service they expect isn’t available. In more extreme cases, customers may trigger legal action towards a company for breaking local laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).   Reduced I.T availability contributes towards the failure of company operations. Bad company operations leads to a loss of time &amp; money resources for a company. More importantly, lower availability causes a loss of trust amongst new &amp; current customers of a company. The following chart, produced by Statistica shows just how much revenue can be lost from a single hour of an I.T downtime occurrence (data collected from 1000+ organisations worldwide). 25% of respondents claim their average annual loss from I.T downtime occurrence is ~$301,000 to ~$400,000  (or approximately ~£227,000 to ~£301,000) per hour.   I.T threats, including Cyber Security attacks and physical attacks towards I.T systems can result in more serious issues, such as closure of a company entirely,  in more extreme cases. Recent Cyber Security statistics demonstrate shockingly high metrics as a result of attack vectors towards I.T systems. These are predicted to grow even higher over the next 5 years, as the usage of technology continues to grow:      Data breaches exposed 4.1 billion records in the first half of 2019. (Source: Norton)       52% of breaches featured hacking, 28% involved malware and 32–33% included phishing or social engineering, respectively. (Source: Verizon)       By 2020, the estimated number of passwords used by humans and machines worldwide will grow to 300 billion. (Source: Cybersecurity Media)    The truth is, running I.T efficiently &amp; effectively requires well thought out processes and a great deal of expertise.  Achieving a 100% uptime Service Level Agreement (SLA) with your customers shouldn’t be your primary goal; Instead, focusing on strategising your I.T for the unknowns and providing service robustness for your I.T systems should be your desired goal.  There is no single reason why I.T downtime occurs, though there are dozens of processes that can be implemented to avoid I.T failures or attacks.   Don’t let your business be a victim of I.T downtime. Keep-Alive I.T’s services can help you.  As technical experts with over a decade of experience in the I.T field, we can identify and mitigate potential issues with Software, Infrastructure, and Security proactively before issues occur in production environments, or save your business from I.T issues that have already happened.

The GDPR is the new European legislation meant to replace the 1995 Data Protection Laws.   This regulation, which can be read in full on the CNIL website, is the new European law governing the use and handling of individuals’ personal data.   The GDPR legislation has 3 primary objectives:     To standardize European data protection regulations.   To give citizens control over how their personal data is used.   To make sure that companies are aware of their responsibilities regarding personal data.   When should you be ready for the GDPR?  All businesses should be in compliance with the GDPR as of May 25th, 2018.   To whom does the GDPR apply?  If you collect or process the personal data of any European citizen, regardless of the country in which your company is based, the GDPR affects your business.   The GDPR has also eliminated the distinctions between various types of businesses — including B2B, B2C, for-profit, and nonprofit — meaning the law applies equally to all organizations that process the personal data of European citizens.   Are you looking to make your I.T Systems GDPR Compliant?  If your business or organisation handles customer data and you’re looking for an audit of your existing I.T software &amp; I.T software then we can help. Get in touch today and we’ll evaluate your working processes to determine if your I.T setup is sufficient to meet the requirements of GDPR.  ","categories": [],

The truth is, Businesses are just like Children. They grow bigger over time, they need a solid cashflow to keep alive, and most importantly, they require a huge amount of attention &amp; care. As a result of the previous responsibilities, owning a business takes up a huge chunk of your time. Once you agree to become a Director, or a Partner of a Company, you need to act like its Parent. You are it’s Owner, its Legal Occupier, and its first Point of Contact, meaning you have to do everything you possibly can for the business to survive.   Some common daily tasks for a Company Director, or Company Partner include:     Being an Accountant.   Being a Handyman/Handywoman.   Being an I.T Technician.   Being a Receptionist.   and being a Public Speaker &amp; Public Representative on behalf of a Company.   That’s a lot of tasks for one person to take on, isn’t it? You’re probably thinking “but this what my staff will be for?” but the truth is, you’re not going to have the cashflow to be able to hire talented and experienced staff right away. Experienced staff will expect you to pay them a premium salaried rate and they’ll also expect you to have some Human Resource practises in place as they’ll want to be paid on time.   Solution  So what are your options after learning about the above scenario? Well, you could either learn every skill needed to build your business yourself (which can take years, and is neither efficient, or practical). Your other option is to outsource some of the work to other companies and come up with ways of automating repetitive tasks. This is where Keep-Alive I.T’s services come into the equation, and this is where we want to show you how our I.T &amp; Digital services can be beneficial to your Startup.   Getting Started Growth Stage   Getting Started  If you’re just getting started, you’ll probably want to come up with a name for your business. Once you’ve got a suitable business name, it’s important that you register a domain name on the internet for your brand. A domain name is an identity and a way for people to access information about your business on the internet from a web browsers on their devices. An example of a domain name is: ‘digiagency.co.uk’ (which you’re currently browsing right now!). Registering a domain name for your business will cost you, but this depends exactly which domain name you want to buy. It’s important to register a domain name when you open your business, as there’s a potential risk that someone else could snap up the domain name you want. DigiAgency sells domain names, so please check out our Domain Name Registration service if you’d like to register a domain name with us.   Once you’ve got a domain name, you’ll need to get a Website designed for your business so information about your business is presented to your customers nicely. This website will be accessible from the domain name you just bought, so if you’ve got multiple web pages they’ll need to be linked together to keep things consistent for your users. The process of designing a website for your business can be quite cumbersome, so that’s why it’s a good idea to hire an external company to do this. DigiAgency has 10+ years of experience with designing websites and knows of the latest and greatest design trends on the internet. If you’d like to hire us to take care of designing your business website, please see our Web Design service page.   In addition to designing a website, you’ll also need someone to develop it. This involves programming the design using a markup language called HTML.   If you’ve got interactive elements to your website, you’ll also need to use CSS and JavaScript to get your page looking nice and working as expected. You’ll need a web developer to work on this for you. DigiAgency has 10+ years of experience with developing websites, so please check out our Web Development service page if you’d like to know more information about the process of developing a website. Once you’ve got your website designed and developed, you’ll need to find a Web Host that can ‘host’ the website for you. ‘Hosting’ is the process of renting server resources from a Web Hosting Reseller and placing your website files on their server so your website is accessible over the internet. Buying Web Hosting saves you as a business from having to deal with the hassle of hosting an on-premise server, which can be expensive and involves expertise of the internet and computing systems. DigiAgency offers ultra fast Web Hosting at competitive pricing, so be sure to check out our Web Hosting page for more information. Once you’ve got your website online, you’ll probably want to start communicating with customers and signing up to other internet services, for this, you’ll need an email address. Email works by sending data packets over the internet using different rules (which are called protocols in the computing world). These protocols include SMTP, POP, and IMAP. Once you’ve got email hosting, you can send &amp; receive emails under your own customised alias and any messages sent to that alias will be delivered to the mailboxes you specify. E.g. If you want to create an email alias for dealing with the sales department of your business, you’d want to create an alias called “sales” for your domain name. This could be: ‘sales@yourdomain.com’ and then you could setup a forwarding rule so any messages sent to this email address will be forwarded to multiple mailboxes. DigiAgency offers email hosting as a standalone package, or as an all inclusive solution included with our Web Hosting package. If you’d like to buy email hosting for your business so you can manage email in this way, please check out our Email Hosting service page.   By this point, you should have everything needed to establish your business’s brand online. In the next section we’ll explain some of the other things needed to grow your online presence.   Growing your Startup’s online presence  Once you’ve established your online brand and your new website has launched, you’ll need to work on promoting your website so you can provide your customers with the information needed to make sales for your Company. The best way of making sales online is to publish content and engage with your target audience by communicating with them on a regular basis using online social media channels. However, more content does not always mean more customers! You need to find the balance by posting the right content at the right time and keep a positive attitude towards talking to your followers. This process is known as Social Media Management. Although Social Media Management is easy to do, many companies decide to outsource this work completely as it can be a very time consuming task. DigiAgency is able to manage your Social Media profiles efficiently, please see our Social Media Management service for more information.   If you’re serious about gaining more of an insight about your customers and how potential customers are engaging with your website, it’s a good idea to install Analytics and Tracking software on your website.   To gather even more information about the users who are using your website, you’ll need to send out Surveys to your users and add Forms to your website which gather email addresses. DigiAgency offers a Forms and Survey Generation service for this.   Once you’ve acquired enough email addresses, it’s a good idea to produce Marketing Emails to sell new goods to your customers. DigiAgency offers an Email Marketing service.   As you’ve now collected a great amount of data about your customers from the previous steps, you should now focus on improving the SEO of your website as there’s a good chance it’s not as good as it should be if you didn’t put enough money into making your website SEO friendly in the first place. SEO stands for ‘Search Engine Optimisation’ and is the process of performing changes to your website so Search Engines such as Google and Bing.   Getting their MVP finished at an affordable price.

How to update an Android Phone  Why is keeping an Android Phone updated important?  Android Phones are subject to malware (a shortened term used to describe malicious software). ot updating software on an Android Phone could leave an Android Phone exposed to security vulnerabilities and subject to being a victim of being infected by viruses. Computer viruses are a type of Software that can be used to make computing devices perform illegal activities over the internet. This can occur on a single device, or across an entire network of devices if the malware is sophisticated enough to cause severe damage.   We won’t go into too much detail on how computer viruses are created &amp; operate as this is beyond the scope of this guide. However, a key point to make you aware of is that Software viruses can load &amp; execute themselves onto an Android Phone with or without your knowledge. This is done by taking advantage of security holes left in software that has been partially developed &amp; tested, or patched incorrectly. Viruses come in different forms and some can be more severe to your devices than others, depending on the complexity of the the malicious software and how it exploits the security hole that exists on your device, or its network.   Groups of people, or individuals who have the intent of performing malicious acts by using your computing resource(s) are known as ‘hackers’. Hackers are malicious people who have the intent of stealing your personal information, or using your device’s computing power to attack other devices on a network to ‘hack’ others.  This process (known as ‘hacking’) is in breach of the computer misuse act and is highly illegal.   Being ‘hacked’ should be a high risk factor for anyone that owns a computing device.  It may seem like we’re preaching about Android Phone security but please don’t fret, as the process of applying software updates to an Android Phone is actually a lot simpler than it seems. Applying Software updates is also one of the most effective ways of protecting against viruses and maintaining your cyber resilience efforts. Keeping an Android Phone updated keeps you one step ahead of hackers and mitigates the possibility of an Android Phone being compromised by malicious software.   So to reiterate, taking proactive measures towards keeping software updated is one of the few thing consumers can do to ensure their devices aren’t exposed to malware and cyber attacks. By upgrading the Software on your Mac you’ll avoid issues such as Corruption of an Android Phone hard drive, Losing your work, or having confidential information stolen. Now that you’ve learned why it is important to keep an Android Phone updated, we will show you how to update the Mac OS Software on an Android Phone.   How to update the Mac OS Software on an Android Phone   Step 0 - Prerequisites  As a prerequisite, make sure you have enough hard drive or solid state drive storage available to install a software update on your Android Phone. You can check Apple’s website for more information about the size of Mac OS updates. You must also connect an Android Phone to a power outlet to ensure your Android Phone has enough power to apply and complete the software update procedure successfully.   Step 1 - Click the Apple Icon in the top left of MacOS to reveal the ‘Apple menu’  It doesn’t matter which window you currently have in focus within Mac OS as the Apple Icon will always be visible unless you have a software application open in a maximised state. If this is the case then please hover your mouse cursor near the top left of the Window to reveal the Apple logo. Simply click the Apple icon to display a context menu that looks like the following:     Step 2 - Open up ‘System Preferences’ from the MacOS Window  This is some text     Step 3 - Allow some time for MacOS to check for system updates.  If there are no updates available, then MacOS will display a message and you can safely continue to use your Android Phone as usual.     Step 4  This is some text     Step 5  You will need to agree to the MacOS license agreement. Please read through this carefully and then click the ‘Agree’ button if you agree to the terms.     &lt;!–&lt;div class=\"divider div-transparent div-arrow-down\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   That’s the end of the process. You may now sit back and wait for the update to complete. Your Mac may restart several times throughout the update process, so don’t panic if this happens.   Quick Tip:  It’s possible for an Android Phone to check for software updates automatically, which automates the process above. This is a feature we’d suggest enabling to save you the hassle of having to check for software updates manually, and to maintain a consistent level of security for an Android Phone.

In fact, the situation is the complete opposite to this as Macs CAN get viruses and not updating software on a Macbook could leave a Macbook exposed to security vulnerabilities and subject to being a victim of being infected by viruses. Computer viruses are a type of Software that can be used to make computing devices perform illegal activities over the internet. This can occur on a single device, or across an entire network of devices if the malware is sophisticated enough to cause severe damage.   We won’t go into too much detail on how computer viruses are created &amp; operate as this is beyond the scope of this guide. However, a key point to make you aware of is that Software viruses can load &amp; execute themselves onto a Macbook with or without your knowledge. This is done by taking advantage of security holes left in software that has been partially developed &amp; tested, or patched incorrectly. Viruses come in different forms and some can be more severe to your devices than others, depending on the complexity of the the malicious software and how it exploits the security hole that exists on your device, or its network.   Groups of people, or individuals who have the intent of performing malicious acts by using your computing resource(s) are known as ‘hackers’. Hackers are malicious people who have the intent of stealing your personal information, or using your device’s computing power to attack other devices on a network to ‘hack’ others.  This process (known as ‘hacking’) is in breach of the computer misuse act and is highly illegal.   Being ‘hacked’ should be a high risk factor for anyone that owns a computing device.  It may seem like we’re preaching about Macbook security but please don’t fret, as the process of applying software updates to a Macbook is actually a lot simpler than it seems. Applying Software updates is also one of the most effective ways of protecting against viruses and maintaining your cyber resilience efforts. Keeping a Macbook updated keeps you one step ahead of hackers and mitigates the possibility of a Macbook being compromised by malicious software.   So to reiterate, taking proactive measures towards keeping software updated is one of the few thing consumers can do to ensure their devices aren’t exposed to malware and cyber attacks. By upgrading the Software on your Mac you’ll avoid issues such as Corruption of a Macbook hard drive, Losing your work, or having confidential information stolen. Now that you’ve learned why it is important to keep a Macbook updated, we will show you how to update the Mac OS Software on a Macbook.   How to update the Mac OS Software on a Macbook   Step 0 - Prerequisites  As a prerequisite, make sure you have enough hard drive or solid state drive storage available to install a software update on your Macbook. You can check Apple’s website for more information about the size of Mac OS updates. You must also connect a Macbook to a power outlet to ensure your Macbook has enough power to apply and complete the software update procedure successfully.   Step 1 - Click the Apple Icon in the top left of MacOS to reveal the ‘Apple menu’  It doesn’t matter which window you currently have in focus within Mac OS as the Apple Icon will always be visible unless you have a software application open in a maximised state. If this is the case then please hover your mouse cursor near the top left of the Window to reveal the Apple logo. Simply click the Apple icon to display a context menu that looks like the following:      Step 2 - Open up ‘System Preferences’ from the MacOS Window  This is some text      Step 3 - Allow some time for MacOS to check for system updates.  If there are no updates available, then MacOS will display a message and you can safely continue to use your Macbook as usual.      Step 4  This is some text      Step 5  You will need to agree to the MacOS license agreement. Please read through this carefully and then click the ‘Agree’ button if you agree to the terms.        That’s the end of the process. You may now sit back and wait for the update to complete. Your Mac may restart several times throughout the update process, so don’t panic if this happens.   Quick Tip:  It’s possible for a Macbook to check for software updates automatically, which automates the process above. This is a feature we’d suggest enabling to save you the hassle of having to check for software updates manually, and to maintain a consistent level of security for a Macbook.   Thanks for reading - still stuck, or too lazy to complete the process yourself?  We hope this guide has served you well and you are now able to update the Software on a Macbook without any issues.
