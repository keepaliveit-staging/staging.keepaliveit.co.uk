### AWS introduction: a brief introduction to Amazon's Cloud Platform
As an Enterprise Business owner or representative, chances are that you've more than likely heard of Amazon Web Services (AWS) before. This is because AWS is now one of the leading Cloud Providers in existence and it's huge growth of popularity in recent years is showing little signs of slowing down.

If you're completely new to AWS, then there's little we need to do to convince you that AWS is *probably* the right Cloud platform choice for your SME. Here are just some advantages moving to the Cloud can bring to an organisation:

What Amazon says about their Cloud Infrastructure:
>AWS pioneered cloud computing in 2006, creating cloud infrastructure that allows you to securely build and innovate faster. We are continuously innovating the design and systems of our data centers to protect them from man-made and natural risks. Then we implement controls, build automated systems, and undergo third-party audits to confirm security and compliance. As a result, the most highly-regulated organizations in the world trust AWS every day.

Amazon's global infrastructure setup makes AWS the go-to Cloud platform for many Enterprises.
Having a foundational understanding of AWS Cloud topics is vital to understand the benefits AWS can bring to a business. If you've never heard of AWS before, then you may wish to read our <a href="/aws-introduction">AWS introduction writeup</a> to learn more information about the platform.

By hiring Keep-Alive I.T to implement, or manage AWS Cloud Services on behalf of your enterprise, a significant improvement to I.T Operations can be achieved across individual departments, or even an entire organisation.

Depending on the size of your Enterprise, you may or may not have an on-site datacenter or services running locally on site. Maybe in the corner of an office of a single department? To put things simply, the aim of AWS was to get rid of on-premise servers at the location of your enterprise, and create a globally distributed network of servers and associated I.T infrastructure that is ready to rent on demand.

### Why lock your business into AWS?
Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a substantial amount of Cloud services that can be used to perform simple computation operations for hobbyist software developers, or running highly complex application workloads with an enterprise grade Service Level Agreement (SLA).
The flexibility of using Amazon Web Services with projects has deemed it a good choice of Cloud provider due to its Capital Expenditure (CapEx) pricing model. Taking the plunge to migrate application workloads to AWS is a decision that must be made with much thought but the exact answer for that decision depends on your current I.T setup and requirements.

### How much does AWS cost?
There is no definitive answer to what is the cost of AWS services as the needs and requirements of every enterprise of startup company will be different.
Part of our consultancy service is giving an estimated cost as to how much it will cost to operate your application workload(s) on AWS.
Some AWS services are free but some are charged at a rate defined by AWS.

What exactly is a Service Level Agreement (SLA)?
A service level agreement metric is the uptime guarantee of a service and is a term most commonly used in I.T Service Management (ITSM) professions.

Shouldn't I always choose a Service Level Agreement that's 100%?
Not necessarily. An uptime of 100% is extremely rare to come by. Even the shortest of application changes can occur *some* downtime for your users.

Why use Amazon Web Services?
- More cost effective than hosting & maintaining application workloads using on-premise hardware.


Promotes Machine Learning, Compute, Storage, and Analytics.

We can migrate data on a large scale using high performance devices with capacities of up to 5TB.
