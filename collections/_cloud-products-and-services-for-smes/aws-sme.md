### Why lock your business into AWS?
Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a substantial amount of Cloud services that can be used to perform simple computation operations for hobbyist software developers, or running highly complex application workloads with an enterprise grade Service Level Agreement (SLA).
The flexibility of using Amazon Web Services with projects has deemed it a good choice of Cloud provider due to its Capital Expenditure (CapEx) pricing model. Taking the plunge to migrate application workloads to AWS is a decision that must be made with much thought but the exact answer for that decision depends on your current I.T setup and requirements.

### How much does AWS cost?
There is no definitive answer to what is the cost of AWS services as the needs and requirements of every enterprise of startup company will be different.
Part of our consultancy service is giving an estimated cost as to how much it will cost to operate your application workload(s) on AWS.
Some AWS services are free but some are charged at a rate defined by AWS.

What exactly is a Service Level Agreement (SLA)?
A service level agreement metric is the uptime guarantee of a service and is a term most commonly used in I.T Service Management (ITSM) professions.

Shouldn't I always choose a Service Level Agreement that's 100%?
Not necessarily. An uptime of 100% is extremely rare to come by. Even the shortest of application changes can occur *some* downtime for your users.

Why use Amazon Web Services?
- More cost effective than hosting & maintaining application workloads using on-premise hardware.
