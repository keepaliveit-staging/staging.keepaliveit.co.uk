### AWS Overview: an overview of Amazon's Cloud Platform
As an Enterprise Business owner or representative, there's a high chance that you've heard of Amazon Web Services (AWS) before. This is because AWS is now one of the leading Cloud Providers in existence, and its huge growth of popularity in recent years is showing little signs of slowing down.

The information contained on this page will outline the main uses of AWS, the benefits it brings to SME's, and give details of the managed AWS services we offer.

<h3 id="aws-customers">Top AWS customers</h3>
Amazon has some of the largest companies in the world onboard with its cloud subscription model. These companies often hire dedicated cloud specialists to setup and maintain their I.T infrastructure, but some choose to hire an I.T agency like ours to get the job done without the cost and effort overhead of having to hire in-house.

<img src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/companies-using-aws-ec2.png" class="img-fluid" />

What Amazon says about their Cloud Infrastructure:
>AWS pioneered cloud computing in 2006, creating cloud infrastructure that allows you to securely build and innovate faster. We are continuously innovating the design and systems of our data centers to protect them from man-made and natural risks. Then we implement controls, build automated systems, and undergo third-party audits to confirm security and compliance. As a result, the most highly-regulated organizations in the world trust AWS every day.

Amazon's global infrastructure setup makes AWS the go-to Cloud platform for many Enterprises.
Having a foundational understanding of AWS Cloud topics is vital to understand the benefits AWS can bring to a business. If you've never heard of AWS before, then you may wish to read our <a href="/aws-introduction">AWS introduction writeup</a> to learn more information about the platform.

If you're new to AWS but have foundational knowledge of Storage, Network, and Compute Services the platform can still seem quite overwhelming as there are literally hundreds of services offered by AWS.

Is your SME thinking of migrating its existing I.T services, or implementing new I.T services onto AWS infrastructure?

However, don't let this put you off! Our Cloud consultants and project managers are here to help simplify the process of creating new cloud workloads, or migrating existing I.T workloads onto AWS so that companies can reap the benefits of Cloud technology.

AWS offers Iaas, PaaS, and SaaS cloud functionality for its clients.

### What could an AWS migration do for my SME?
Gone are the days of struggling with complicated on-premise server rooms and complicated networking.

Our AWS Cloud consultancy services

By hiring Keep-Alive I.T to implement, or manage AWS Cloud Services on behalf of your enterprise, a significant improvement to I.T Operations can be achieved across individual departments, or even an entire organisation.

Depending on the size of your Enterprise, you may or may not have an on-site datacenter or services running locally on site. Maybe in the corner of an office of a single department? To put things simply, the aim of AWS was to get rid of on-premise servers at the location of your enterprise, and create a globally distributed network of servers and associated I.T infrastructure that is ready to rent on demand. 



So, to summarise; Just as if your company was to build a fleet of servers and place them in a

### Managed vs. unmanaged instances

As an established SME, you know your line of business and understand your revenue streams well. One thing that separates your business from others is your selling capabilities and the amount of cashflow that runs through your business.

### Why lock your business into AWS?
Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a substantial amount of Cloud services that can be used to perform simple computation operations for hobbyist software developers, or running highly complex application workloads with an enterprise grade Service Level Agreement (SLA).
The flexibility of using Amazon Web Services with projects has deemed it a good choice of Cloud provider due to its Capital Expenditure (CapEx) pricing model. Taking the plunge to migrate application workloads to AWS is a decision that must be made with much thought but the exact answer for that decision depends on your current I.T setup and requirements.

### How much does AWS cost?
There is no definitive answer to what is the cost of AWS services as the needs and requirements of every enterprise of startup company will be different.
Part of our consultancy service is giving an estimated cost as to how much it will cost to operate your application workload(s) on AWS.
Some AWS services are free but some are charged at a rate defined by AWS.

About Amazon's Datacentres:

Other companies who host their application workloads with AWS:
- Netflix
- Twitch
- LinkedIn
- Facebook
- BBC

- Shell

For a full and upto date list of Enterprises and Startups who are using AWS, please see their <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/">Customer References</a> page.

What exactly is a Service Level Agreement (SLA)?
A service level agreement metric is the uptime guarantee of a service and is a term most commonly used in I.T Service Management (ITSM) professions.

Shouldn't I always choose a Service Level Agreement that's 100%?
Not necessarily. An uptime of 100% is extremely rare to come by. Even the shortest of application changes can occur *some* downtime for your users.

Why use Amazon Web Services?
- More cost effective than hosting & maintaining application workloads using on-premise hardware.


Promotes Machine Learning, Compute, Storage, and Analytics.

We can migrate data on a large scale using high performance devices with capacities of up to 5TB.
