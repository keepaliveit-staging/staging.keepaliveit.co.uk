## What is the GDPR?

The GDPR is the new European legislation meant to replace the 1995 Data Protection Laws.

This regulation, which can be read in full on the <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/gdpr_guide-for-processors_en.pdf">CNIL website</a>, is the new European law governing the use and handling of individuals’ personal data.

The GDPR legislation has 3 primary objectives:
- To standardize European data protection regulations.
- To give citizens control over how their personal data is used.
- To make sure that companies are aware of their responsibilities regarding personal data.

## When should you be ready for the GDPR?
All businesses should be in compliance with the GDPR as of May 25th, 2018.

## To whom does the GDPR apply?
If you collect or process the personal data of any European citizen, regardless of the country in which your company is based, the GDPR affects your business.

The GDPR has also eliminated the distinctions between various types of businesses — including B2B, B2C, for-profit, and nonprofit — meaning the law applies equally to all organizations that process the personal data of European citizens.
