            <h2>The journey of migrating Public Sector I.T workloads to AWS Cloud technologies: </h2>
            <p>On-boarding Public Sector Organisations with Cloud technology is never an easy task and is a movement which requires a deep amount of technical knowledge to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible. The process of migrating traditional I.T infrastructure to Cloud is usually a gradual movement which can take many months, or even years to implement. Cloud migrations usually cost upwards of a few Million pounds to implement, dependant on the scale of the I.T workload being migrated. However, the cost and elasticity benefits that are introduced as a result of a cloud migration being completed are often significant enough to be considered as a solid I.T investment for Public Sector Organisations. This benefit alone often entices the movement of gradually shifting I.T workloads to be Cloud powered. Another game changing benefit of introducing Cloud movements to Public Sector Organisations, comes thanks to its elasticity characteristics. Elasticity encourages organisations to be more agile and promotes future projects to be shipped to the public up-to 1000x faster than using traditional I.T hosting environments. Once an organisation hits this point of their Cloud related journey, they will start to adapt a DevOps culture and embrace a new way of working.</p>
            <p>The UK Government has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cloud-guide-for-the-public-sector/cloud-guide-for-the-public-sector" target="_blank">published guidance on Public Cloud Technology</a> on it's website. This document is suited for technical leads of Public Sector Organisations and aims to give an overview of the process of migrating I.T workloads to the Cloud. Key objectives of the document are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>to help technical leads decide on, and implement cloud strategies.</li>
                <li>to help technical teams with implementing migrations to cloud services.</li>
                <li>to help technical teams with managing cloud resources and Cloud spending budgets.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>As good of a resource that this is, there is much more groundwork than highlighted in this document to get I.T workloads migrated onto Cloud technologies. One of the biggest setbacks for Public Sector Organisations is that they must hire additional staff resources to even begin migrating I.T workloads. Hiring project managers, cloud experts, database experts, application developers, solutions architects, and testers certainly doesn't come cheap, and training staff to be equipped with the required skills is often he biggest hurdle to overcome.</p>
             <p>This is where we, Keep-Alive I.T come into the equation and are able to step in and help Public Sector Organisations to make better decisions with their Cloud related work items. Operating Clouds at high scale, and maintaining Clouds for Our goal here at Keep-Alive I.T is to consult you of the steps involved with embracing Cloud technologies</p>
            <p>If your Public Sector Organisation already has an AWS Setup that needs managing, you can jump straight to our services overview to see if hiring us to manage your Cloud infrastructure and associated applications is the right fit for your Organisation.</p>

        <h2>AWS Cloud offerings: Diving deeper into the Cloud services Amazon offers</h2>
        <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the World's leading Cloud Computing providers. Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of I.T resources via the internet, with a pay-as-you-go pricing model.</p>
            
            <p>Organisations of every type, size and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases. Including (but not limited to); data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and customer facing web applications. Public Sector Organisations could be utilising the benefits of an AWS Cloud to give a better experience to the public, whilst saving thousands of pounds on I.T operation costs.
            </p>
                                
            <p>Amazon Web Services works like this; Instead of buying, owning and maintaining physical data centers and server on-site, you can access a gigantic pool of technology resources, such as computing power, storage and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS focuses on the setup of complex infrastructure sites across the globe and physical security of Data Centres. This means that a Public Sector Organisation has to do to reap the benefits of aPublic Cloud provider is hire a specialised team of I.T professionals to Architect, Operate, and Maintain Cloud based I.T workloads. It can often be tricky to find AWS Cloud Consultants due to the amount of technical expertise required. However, that shouldn't put Public Sector Organisations off using Cloud technologies as there are companies like Keep-Alive I.T around to help with this.
            </p>
        
        <p>Whether this is the first time you've come across Amazon Web Services, or you've been using Amazon Web Services for months/years, this page will include some free information on AWS topics. More advanced topics will require a consultancy session with us. These are charged at £50 per hour (inc. VAT) for public sector organisations.</p>

    <blockquote data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-once="true" class="aos-init aos-animate">
        Public sector healthcare organizations around the world use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to analyze their data,
            improve patient care in the communities they serve, and empower teams with the tools needed to assess,
            diagnose, and treat in real time. Using AWS, healthcare organizations can reduce the time and effort
            required to run existing clinical and non-clinical workloads and provide access to new analytics
            capabilities and machine learning technologies that meet both regional and global security and privacy
            requirements.

<h3>Why lock your business into AWS?</h3>
Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a substantial amount of Cloud services that can be used to perform simple computation operations for hobbyist software developers, or running highly complex application workloads with an enterprise grade Service Level Agreement (SLA).
The flexibility of using Amazon Web Services (AWS) with projects has deemed it a good choice of Cloud provider due to its Capital Expenditure (CapEx) pricing model. Taking the plunge to migrate application workloads to AWS is a decision that must be made with much thought but the exact answer for that decision depends on your current I.T setup and requirements.

<h3>How much does AWS cost?</h3>
There is no definitive answer to what is the cost of AWS services as the needs and requirements of every enterprise of startup company will be different.
Part of our consultancy service is giving an estimated cost as to how much it will cost to operate your application workload(s) on AWS.
Some AWS services are free but some are charged at a rate defined by AWS.

What exactly is a Service Level Agreement (SLA)?
A service level agreement metric is the uptime guarantee of a service and is a term most commonly used in I.T Service Management (ITSM) professions.

Shouldn't I always choose a Service Level Agreement that's 100%?
Not necessarily. An uptime of 100% is extremely rare to come by. Even the shortest of application changes can occur *some* downtime for your users.

Why use Amazon Web Services?
- More cost effective than hosting & maintaining application workloads using on-premise hardware.
