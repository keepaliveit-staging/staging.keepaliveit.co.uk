## Keeping Windows Desktop Software Updated
### Why is keeping a Macbook updated important?
One popular misconception people have about Macbooks (and Macs in general) is that “Macs don’t get viruses”.
This leads consumers to believe that there isn't a need to keep on top of updating Mac OS on a Macbook and that Macbooks are invincible to malware (a shortened term used to describe malicious software). In fact, the situation is the complete opposite to this as Macs *CAN* get viruses and not updating software on a Macbook could leave a Macbook exposed to security vulnerabilities and subject to being a victim of being infected by viruses.
Computer viruses are a type of Software that can be used to make computing devices perform illegal activities over the internet. This can occur on a single device, or across an entire network of devices if the malware is sophisticated enough to cause severe damage.

We won't go into too much detail on how computer viruses are created & operate as this is beyond the scope of this guide. However, a key point to make you aware of is that Software viruses can load & execute themselves onto a Macbook *with* or *without your knowledge*. This is done by taking advantage of security holes left in software that has been partially developed & tested, or patched incorrectly. Viruses come in different forms and some can be more severe to your devices than others, depending on the complexity of the the malicious software and how it exploits the security hole that exists on your device, or its network.

Groups of people, or individuals who have the intent of performing malicious acts by using your computing resource(s) are known as 'hackers'. Hackers are malicious people who have the intent of stealing your personal information, or using your device's computing power to attack other devices on a network to 'hack' others. 
This process (known as 'hacking') is in breach of the computer misuse act and is highly illegal. 

Being 'hacked' should be a high risk factor for anyone that owns a computing device. 
It may seem like we're preaching about Macbook security but please don't fret, as the process of applying software updates to a Macbook is actually a lot simpler than it seems. Applying Software updates is also one of the most effective ways of protecting against viruses and maintaining your cyber resilience efforts.
Keeping a Macbook updated keeps you one step ahead of hackers and mitigates the possibility of a Macbook being compromised by malicious software.    

So to reiterate, taking proactive measures towards keeping software updated is one of the few thing consumers can do to ensure their devices aren't exposed to malware and cyber attacks. By upgrading the Software on your Mac you'll avoid issues such as Corruption of a Macbook hard drive, Losing your work, or having confidential information stolen.
Now that you've learned why it is important to keep a Macbook updated, we will show you how to update the Mac OS Software on a Macbook.

### How to update the Mac OS Software on a Macbook

#### Step 0 - Prerequisites
As a prerequisite, make sure you have enough hard drive or solid state drive storage available to install a software update on your Macbook. You can check Apple's website for more information about the size of Mac OS updates. You must also connect a Macbook to a power outlet to ensure your Macbook has enough power to apply and complete the software update procedure successfully.

#### Step 1 - Click the Apple Icon in the top left of MacOS to reveal the 'Apple menu'
It doesn't matter which window you currently have in focus within Mac OS as the Apple Icon will always be visible unless you have a software application open in a maximised state. If this is the case then please hover your mouse cursor near the top left of the Window to reveal the Apple logo. Simply click the Apple icon to display a context menu that looks like the following:

#### Step 2 - Open up 'System Preferences' from the MacOS Window

#### Step 3 - Allow some time for MacOS to check for system updates.
If there are no updates available, then MacOS will display a message and you can safely continue to use your Macbook as usual.

#### Step 5
You will need to agree to the MacOS license agreement. Please read through this carefully and then click the 'Agree' button if you agree to the terms.

That's the end of the process. You may now sit back and wait for the update to complete. Your Mac may restart several times throughout the update process, so don't panic if this happens.

### Quick Tip:
It's possible for a Macbook to check for software updates automatically, which automates the process above. This is a feature we'd suggest enabling to save you the hassle of having to check for software updates manually, and to maintain a consistent level of security for a Macbook.

### Thanks for reading - still stuck, or too lazy to complete the process yourself?
We hope this guide has served you well and you are now able to update the Software on a Macbook without any issues. If you're stuck or would prefer use to do the process for you, please check out our Operating System upgrade service for more information.
